# I already bumped our flac module and this makes liquidsoap 1.3 build again, this won't be needed after
# liquidsoap 1.4 is released though. 1.4 will depend on ocaml 4.08 which is another can of worms.

%description
Liquidsoap is a powerful and flexible language for describing your streams. It
offers a rich collection of operators that you can combine at will, giving you
more power than you need for creating or transforming streams. But liquidsoap
is still very light and easy to use, in the Unix tradition of simple strong
components working together.
